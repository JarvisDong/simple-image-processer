I am glad to take a class that
using C/C++ as main programming languages.
Before this class,
I used Java, Python, Javascript to do homework.
And also I've tried C# with friends on a Unity project.
But, when I browsed sites and forums,
I've seen so many senior programmers claim
how good C/C++ is.
That's how I heared in C.

At first I thought C/C++ is
an old creepy outdated programming languages
for they are out long years ago.
Then I realized sublime-text
lauches much faster than Atom(2015).
And Atom, someday, to be fast,
rewrites the bottom level with C++.
That's how I heard C is high-performanced.

I know C is not OOP.
To sovle this is one of meanings C++ existence.
considering project3 is OOP(super hard),
I guess we will cover C++ around that moment.
I've read some C++ grammer.
It looks not much complicated as C.

I've used C in class CIS314,
it feels not old not outdated but still creepy for me.
To implement what I can do with lines
even letters on python3,
I need to write longer in C.
There are plenty of built-in candies
in interepted langauges
while C does not.
But I still would love to learn C/C++.
I want to grasp them espcially Hank showed me
there are so many great softwares
and system-level applications are done by C/C++.
Maybe python works better on some situations,
like data mining.
Golang serves great on server-end.
Java programs can be run at any devices
with JVM.
But C/C++,
give me a strong feeling that they are
very essential to a cs student.
On short term,
I need prepare myself with C/C++
since there is a nightmare named CIS415 right
on my way to graduate.
And for track classes, C is also required
